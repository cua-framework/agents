INFO:root:entry1={'role': 'assistant', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': "I apologize, but I notice that you're asking to buy glasses, but the URL you provided appears to be for something related to an Amazon file upload API. This seems to be a mismatch. \n\nIf you'd like to buy glasses at the cheapest price, I can help you navigate to some popular online eyewear retailers that are known for competitive pricing, such as:\n- Zenni Optical\n- EyeBuyDirect\n- GlassesUSA\n- Warby Parker\n\nWould you like me to help you navigate to one of these websites instead? Please let me know which one you'd prefer, or if you'd like to see options from multiple retailers to compare prices.\n\nAdditionally, to help you find the best price, it would be helpful to know:\n1. Do you need prescription glasses or non-prescription?\n2. Do you have a specific style in mind?\n3. Do you have a budget range you're looking to stay within?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed."}]}
