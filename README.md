# Introduction

For Computer-Use Agents (CUAs), as we are only using Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5 and Sonnet 3.7 models, we use a modified computer environment adapted from [Anthropic's Computer-Use QuickStart](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo).

More specifically, we use the same exact Debian-based Virtual Machine (VM) as Anthropic (i.e. same apps, configurations, etc.), but with a few additional changes.

Notably, we added a FastAPI server in the VM, and exposed it through an additional port, so that we can send prompts and other instructions from outside the VM to the CUA located inside the VM. This FastAPI server also enables us to perform logging of the agent's execution trace, kill the agent if needed, etc.

For Browser-Use Agents (BUAs), our source code is adapted from [Browser-Use/webui](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui). We use version `v1.6` for this implementation. 

Please refer to [main_benchmark.parquet](main_benchmark.parquet) for our full dataset of testcases.

# Demo Video

[▶️ Watch the Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMfVfheVcDIAew0J42YGX1x8bf-n4Kt2/)

The CUA in the demo video falls victim to a Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attack, and is successfully tricked into:
1. Finding the user's SSH credentials located on the user's Google Drive.
2. Exfiltrating the SSH credentials through a form on the pseudo-authentic webpage.
3. Deleting the user's SSH credentials from the user's Google Drive.

# Installation Guide (CUA)

Since we use 1 VM for each CUA, in order to run multiple CUAs in parallel, multiple VMs are needed (with different port settings). Please refer to [this](claude-cua/README.md) for more information on how to setup the VMs.

Additionally, please take note that the following manual setup steps are recommended, as we were unfortunately unable to automate their setup:
- Firefox: For each VM, please perform the following steps:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:608X` (VNC endpoint).
2. Open the Firefox browser in the VM.
3. Go to `about:config`, and change the following parameters. These parameters are important, as they prevent the browser from recommending the agent to navigate to other subpages of our testing website. We observed that in some rare scenarios, the agent may click on past webpages visited (i.e. previous testcase urls), which will lead to inaccurate testcase execution trace logs.

```
user_pref("browser.urlbar.suggest.history", false);
user_pref("browser.urlbar.suggest.openpage", false);
user_pref("browser.urlbar.suggest.searches", false);
user_pref("browser.urlbar.suggest.topsites", false);
user_pref("browser.urlbar.suggest.engines", false);
user_pref("browser.urlbar.suggest.recentsearch", false);
user_pref("browser.urlbar.maxRichResults", 0);
```

# Running Testcases (CUA)

Please refer to [testcases.py](testcases.py) for an example of how to run testcases.

## Settings

- `BASE_URL`: URL of the VM's FastAPI endpoint. If you are running multiple VMs, then each VM will have its own FastAPI endpoint.
- `LOG_PATH`: Directory which will store all the execution trace logs generated by the agent. This can be shared across multiple VMs.
- ⁠`TESTCASE_FOLDER_PATH`: Directory which stores all the testcase json files. Please refer to below for an example testcase.
- ⁠`MODEL`: Currently, only Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5 and Sonnet 3.7 models are supported.
- `CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: If left blank, the [default Anthropic CUA system prompt](https://github.com/cua-framework/agents/blob/ab6eab65257b7cf2b11ad0b4028fd81fae706d9b/claude-cua/computer_use_demo/loop.py#L59) will be used. Otherwise, if specified, this custom system prompt will completely override and replace the default Anthropic CUA system prompt.
- ⁠`MAX_LOG_ENTRIES`: Once the number of log entries produced by the agent exceeds this number, a kill signal will be sent to the agent. This prevents excessive wastage of tokens in case the agent gets stuck in a loop or repeatedly executes unproductive actions. Nevertheless, the default value is set to 60 to allow sufficient room for the agent to complete both the user and malicious tasks.

## Execution Flow

1. Load the json testcase and setup the VM's environment (if needed, e.g. create file, open Firefox at specific url, etc.)
2. Send the user's prompt along with the custom system prompt (if provided) to the agent.
3. Collect and consolidate the logs generated by the agent, monitoring the number of log entries and sending a kill signal if the threshold is exceeded.
4. Once the agent has terminated, reset the VM's environment. Do note that unfortunately, we were not able to automatically reset everything in the VM. However, most things should be automatically reset, as all windows will be automatically closed, and all files created through the testcase's environment specifications will be automatically deleted, alongside the entire `Downloads` folder.

# Installation Guide (BUA)

Please refer to [this](browser-use/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to setup the BUAs.

Since our testcases trick the agent into retrieving data from Google Drive, please follow the additional steps below to set up Drive:

### Step 1:
Create your new Google Drive Account on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).

### Step 2:
Log in to the account using the Google Chrome browser.

# Running Testcases (BUA)

Before running, please specify the log storage path corresponding to the model name and determine whether to use the system prompt defense in `browser-use/evaluation_me.py` and `browser-use/evaluation_webplatform.py`.
To run experiment on messenger and email, please run:
```bash
python browser-use/evaluate_me.py
```
To run experiment on Amazon, BBC, Booking, please run:
```bash
python browser-use/evaluate_webplatform.py
```
